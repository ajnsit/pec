Introducing the pec language and pec embedded compiler.

The intent of pec is to provide a drop-in replacement for C, but with
modern language features.  Pec is a procedural language with a
functional/declarative feel.  Programming in pec is very similar to
monadic programming in Haskell.  The primary use case for pec is to
provide a productive environment for writing safe, efficient, embedded
applications.

Feature list
  - Easy C integration
  - No garbage collection
  - Strong typing with Hindley-Milner type inference
  - Safe pointers, no indexing out of bounds
  - Variants, arrays, tuples, records, arbitrary sized integers
  - User defined, polymorphic data structures
  - Parametric polymorphism, limited ad-hoc polymorphism
  - Modules
  - Compiles to C and LLVM
  - Haskell-ish syntax/layout
  - BSD license

Building
  - type 'make'
  - resolve all hackage dependencies
  - type 'make' again
  - go and get a cup of coffee :)

Pec (the language and the compiler) is in the alpha stage of
development.  The compiler is implemented in Haskell and has a very
small codebase (thanks to several existing Haskell tools/libraries).

You can download and install pec via cabal or access the git
repository on github (git@github.com:stevezhee/pec.git).  You'll need
to have a c compiler installed to build the examples.

Any feedback on the design and/or implementation of pec would be
greatly appreciated :)
